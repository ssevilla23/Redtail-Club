        Welcome to Redtail Ski and Snowboard Club! Whether you’re interested in
        learning how to snowboard for the first time or you’re a long-time
        skiing expert, Redtail Ski and Snowboard Club has something for you. In
        1992, Abdel Melnyk and Steven “Spike” Becker started the RSSC to make
        new friends and celebrate the wonderful world of skiing and snowboarding
        with everyone. Since then, RSSC has maintained around 40 lifetime
        members with countless new friends along the way, leading to continuous
        friendships and special moments. We love to have holiday gatherings and
        potlucks, and cherish the fun and friendship we cultivate for ourselves!
      </p>
      <p>
        RSSC meets at the Retail Mountain Ski Lodge nestled on the west side of
        Redtail Mountain near Galloping Goose Lake. During the winter season,
        we’ll send out emails with an itinerary for our meeting schedule.
        Membership is limited, so it’s a good idea to sign up as soon as you can
        by shooting us an email at membership@redtailssbc.org and telling us a
        little bit about yourself! We ask that you provide us with your full
        name, age, skill level, and what you’re looking to get out of joining
        RSSC. Children are allowed and don’t require a monthly contribution as
        long as they’re 12 or older and accompanied by an adult 18 or older.
        There’s a $10 monthly contribution for all adults that goes towards
        refreshments, parties, and occasional transportation for day trips to
        other mountains. You can also get discounts through the Redtail Mountain
        Ski Lodge cafe and several other shops at Retail Mountain with a
        membership.
      </p>
      <p>
        RSSC does not tolerate any disruptive or disrespectful behavior towards
        other members, staff at Redtail Mountain Ski Lodge, or the mountain and
        its wildlife. We do not condone violent or hateful behavior, littering,
        harassment, or anything that breaks Redtail Mountain Ski Lodge or Retail
        Mountain rules. There is a strict no-drinking policy! We want everyone
        to feel comfortable while skiing and children will be present, please be
        considerate towards others.
      </p>
      <p>
