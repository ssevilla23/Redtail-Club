# ❄️ Redtail Ski & Snowboard Club

The Redtail Ski & Snowboard Club is a fictional club with a website that already contained its completed mobile layout,
and my task was to troubleshoot and finalize the website for desktop users as part of an academic project.
The project was “assigned” by a fictional client–the club president–as a way to demonstrate my CSS skills in a practical setting.

My tasks included:

+ Adapting and finalizing the desktop layout of the website.
+ Improving the accessibility for motion-sickness users.
+ Troubleshooting a few issues such as the bugged hover and active effects on the navigation links.
